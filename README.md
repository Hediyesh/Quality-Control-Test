This is a test project using .net core 9, for making a web api application for a quality control project.

It has client part, gateway part using ocelot and microservices for users, quality control and other services.

For users I used jwt token for authentication. RabbitMQ is used but it needs some edits to work. 

The front is made using html, css and javascript and jquery.
